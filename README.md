# Simple_Chatty_Bot
Project from Jetbrains Academy

Description

Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.
In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

Objective

Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:
1. the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
2. an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)

If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:
Please, try again.

The program should stop on the correct answer and print Congratulations, have a nice day! at the end.
